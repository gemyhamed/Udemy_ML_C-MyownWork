# Udemy_ML_C-MyownWork

This is My own Work on the Udemy Machine Learning Course , i Sometimes drift away from the course lectures so the main body is like the one taught in the course but i add my own changes , improvs and explanations for educational purposes as i intend to use this as a refrence to study/copy from


inside every file you will find the dataset used for that algorithm 


one final note , I am Using Pycharm as my IDE , so it might need some  small changes to run it elsewhere
