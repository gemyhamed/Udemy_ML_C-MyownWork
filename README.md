# Udemy_ML_C-MyownWork

This is My own Work on the Udemy Machine Learning Course , i do drift away from the course lectures so the main body is like the one taught in the course but i add my own changes and improvs 

inside the code you will find alot of explanation for every step done , as i intend to use this as a refrence to study/copy from 

one final note , I am Using Pycharm as my IDE , so it might need some  small changes to run it elsewhere
